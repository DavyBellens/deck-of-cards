A coded deck of cards

Me and my friends were together one night and we didn't have a deck of cards. That's why I decided to code this deck of cards.

At the top you see the code I used to generate the cards. 
I then took all those cards and put them in an array, because I thought that way it used less CPU power.

At the bottom is the little script which randomly selects a card and then removes it from the deck.
